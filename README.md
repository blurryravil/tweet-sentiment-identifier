# Tweet Sentiment Identifier

## Description
Tweet Sentiment Identifier is a Python-based project using Jupyter Notebook to analyze and identify the sentiment of tweets. Although no specific libraries or frameworks are identified, it can be inferred from the repository structure that this project involves machine learning model creation, serialization and deployment.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/{username}/tweet-sentiment-identifier.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python packages by running the requirements.txt file in the root directory
   ```
   pip install -r Pegasus_Final/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook file (Model.ipynb) to build and train the model
   ```
   jupyter notebook Pegasus_Final/Model.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
After setup, you can use the project by running the main.py file:
```
python Pegasus_Final/main.py
```
You can also use the trained model (Model.pkl) and vectoriser (vectoriser-ngram-(1,2).pkl) for your own applications.

## Repository Structure
